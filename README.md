## dns-blocklists

A custom DNS filter for AdGuard Pro designed to block website access.
I created my own blocklist to be more mindful and purposeful with my device usage.
This approach also allows me to tailor the filter to fit my specific needs.

## Requirements

- AdGuard Pro for iOS/iPadOS devices

## How To Use

1. Open **AdGuard Pro** application.
2. Enable **DNS Protection**.
3. Navigate to **Settings → DNS Protection → DNS Filtering → DNS Filters**.
4. Tap **Add a filter**.
5. Add URL linking to the `dns_blocklist.txt` file and select **Next**.
6. _(Optional)_ Rename the new custom filter.
7. Tap **Add**.
8. Done.
